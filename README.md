With almost 3 years of solid, industrial, full time and professional experience and 4+ years of coding experience, you have come to the right person for the right job.

I AM IN ONE SENTENCE
----------------------------------
Strong Engineering Problem Solving Skills in Backend Development with Professional Work Ethics

WHAT I DO DAY TO DAY
----------------------------------
I do coding as part of my daily work with full of love, passion and energy. But in my free time (while staying home), ​I write articles in my tech blog ​(medium.com/@cyantarek​)​ on different topics that I love. Or else I read other people's articles or Books.

WHAT I HAVE
-------------------
I have experience with a couple of technologies, but I’m good at ​Golang​ for ​Microservice or Monolithic based Backend Development, systems tools, ad-hoc tasks​ and ​average on React/Redux​ for ​Frontend​. That means, I'm not good for every type of projects except challenging, complex Backend with bone cracking problem solving and Fullstack SaaS App projects. This is where I shine most of the time.

LITTLE PINCH
--------------------
Things that give me goosebumps - Backend Development, Database Design, System Design, Scalability, Fullstack SaaS Application Development, Networking and System Programming.

KEY POINTS ABOUT ME
------------------------------
I always emphasize on keeping my ​codebase as clean and neat as possible​ for other developers by applying principles like ​SOLID​, ​YAGNI​, ​KISS etc​. Also I follow ​"Standard Project Layout"​ for architecting Golang Projects for better maintainability and extensible. ​I always setup CI/CD pipeline using Gitlab CI or Github Actions before diving into actual coding​. I use abstractions where it is necessary but not everywhere. ​I believe these work processes along with providing working solutions to problems make my seniors/clients happy​.

WHAT I LIKE TO EARN
-------------------------------
I prefer long term relationships with clients like you. So, you can expect a warm, good and professional behavior from me who respects your time (deadlines). Money is not my first need, I take every projects as a new learning endeavor and care them as my baby.
